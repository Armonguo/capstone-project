This repository serves for my finnal capstone project.


**Abstract**: There are abundant articulation about the geo-correlation of crime distribution and landscapes, but few of them explore the topic at the micro-spatial level, with the instrumental variable -- weather condition. This study focus on the interplay of crime location choices with five specific facilities and landscapes including bars, open space, retails, archeological priority area and subway stations. Both approaches about polygon and spatial points are employed in the study, and points data like bars and subway station are also converted into polygon for display. Eight weather conditions are categorized according to the features of rainfall, sunshine and frost days. Consecutive crime data covering three years are collected from the government websites and more than 30,000 crime records are used in analysis. The results shows that there are clustering phenomenon for all landscape types, but the degree of concentration fluctuates cross weather conditions. For outdoor facilities like open space and parks, the tendency of higher attractions to crime is clear on map, while the influence of satisfying weather on indoor facilities like bars, archeological priority area, and subway stations are not so significant. Commercial sites are the most important predictor for crime clustering regardless of weather changes. More latent distribution regulations are also discussed in this study.
